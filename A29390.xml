            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THese Precedents need no other <hi>Encomium,</hi> than that they were the Draughts of that Eminent and Learned Person, the late Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgman;</hi> framed and advised by him during the time of his Practice; when the unhappy Circumstances wherein this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom stood, afforded no other means of Safety to Persons of his Loyalty and Constancy, than a strict Retirement from all Publick Affairs.</p>
            <p>It's well known to several yet alive, in what esteem he was with his Royal Master, King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the First, to whom in the late Troubles he intirely adhered with all imaginable Zeal and Fidelity, and who often imployed him as a Commissioner in the Negotiations then on foot.</p>
            <p>After the ill Successes of the Royal Party had exposed them to the Fury and Rage of their Enemies, he had among others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in that Common Calamity, a plentiful share of Sufferings, which yet could never extort from him the least Compliance with those Powers which then usurped the Government; but betaking himself to a Sedentary kind of Life in his Chamber, he became the great Oracle, not only of his Fellow Sufferers, but of the whole Nation in Matters of Law; his very Enemies not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Estates secure without his Advice.</p>
            <p>Then it was, that these Precedents were framed and advised by him; they being for the most part Settlements between Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the greatest Honour in the Kingdom. And that they were really his no Man can better attest than my self, who was then his Clerk, and a witness to the execution, if not of all, yet of the more considerabl part of them.</p>

            <p>The great abilities of this Eminent Person, his indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Industry, his exquisite and thorough Knowledge in the Laws, the Solidity of his Judgment, the quickness of his Apprehension and Parts, and (to come nearer home to the present Occasion) his excellent Method and happy Way of expressing himself, in his Conveyances, which will easily appear to the Reader, who will here find several things altogether New, and not extant in any Book yet published; are Matters which deserve a far abler Pen than mine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>In tender consideration</hi> whereof, and to the intent the said <hi>R. S. T. S.</hi> and <hi>R.

               </opener>
               <p>I Conceive that care ought to be taken in a <hi>Conveyance,</hi> of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture soever it be, that there be not therein <hi>[Give</hi> and <hi>Grant,]</hi> for they Imply a <hi>General Warranty,</hi> and shall not be qualified by the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Warranty</hi> following; as hath of late been thrice adjudged.</p>

               <head>Sir <hi>Jeffrey Palmer</hi>'s Answer.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>GIve</hi> implies a <hi>Personal Warranty;</hi> and so is not always used. The word <hi>Grant</hi> in a Lease for Years is a <hi>Covenant in Law,</hi> or (as you may call it) a <hi>General Warranty;</hi> if it be not qualified by a <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Warranty in fait.</hi> But if there be a <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Warranty in fait,</hi> Then it is Restrained to the Words of the <hi>Covenant</hi> subsequent.</p>
               <p>But in an <hi>Estate of Inheritance,</hi> where the <hi>Fee</hi> passeth, There the word <hi>Grant</hi> is neither a <hi>Covenant in Law,</hi> nor <hi>Warranty.</hi> For if it should be a <hi>Covenant in Law,</hi> or <hi>Warranty</hi> in it self, it would be there Restrained and Qualified by the <hi>Warranty</hi> and <hi>Covenants in fait.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And a <hi>Deed</hi> to pass an <hi>Inheritance</hi> where <hi>Common</hi> is, cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; for if it be <hi>Common in gross,</hi> it cannot pass by the <hi>Livery,</hi> but must pass by the word <hi>Grant:</hi> And I never yet saw a <hi>Feoffment</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
